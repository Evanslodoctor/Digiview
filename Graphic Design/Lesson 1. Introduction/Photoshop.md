  - Adobe Photoshop CC (Creative Cloud)
  - Understanding Photoshop’s interface: Menu Bar, Tools Panel, Options Bar, Panels (Layers, Adjustments, etc.)
  
- **Workspaces**  
  - Customizing workspaces
  - Saving and loading workspaces
  - Using built-in workspace presets (Essentials, Photography, 3D, etc.)

## 2. File Formats and Resolution
- **Understanding File Formats**  
  - **PSD:** Photoshop’s native file format, retains layers.
  - **JPEG:** Compressed image format, loses quality.
  - **PNG:** Supports transparency, good for web.
  - **GIF:** Supports animations, limited color range.
  - **TIFF:** High-quality image, used for printing.
  
- **Resolution & Image Size**  
  - **DPI/PPI:** Dots per inch (for printing), pixels per inch (for screen display).
  - How resolution affects image quality.
  - Ideal resolution for print (300 DPI) vs. web (72 PPI).

## 3. Layers in Photoshop
- **What are Layers?**  
  Layers stack images or elements in Photoshop, allowing independent editing without affecting other parts of the project.
  
- **Types of Layers**  
  - **Normal Layers:** Editable image data.
  - **Adjustment Layers:** Apply effects like brightness/contrast without affecting the original image.
  - **Shape Layers:** Vector-based shapes.
  - **Text Layers:** Editable text.
  
- **Layer Masking**  
  Masking lets you hide or reveal parts of a layer without deleting data.
  
- **Blending Modes**  
  Control how layers interact with each other (Multiply, Overlay, Screen, etc.).

## 4. Selections and Masking
- **Selection Tools**  
  - **Marquee Tool:** Rectangular, Elliptical selections.
  - **Lasso Tool:** Freehand selections.
  - **Magic Wand:** Selects areas based on color.

  - **Spot Healing Brush:** Removes small imperfections.
  - **Clone Stamp:** Duplicates parts of the image.
  - **Patch Tool:** Repairs larger areas with textures from other parts of the image.
  
- **Pen Tool**  
  - For creating precise paths and vector shapes.
  - Adding and adjusting anchor points.

## 7. Working with Text
- **Text Tool**  
  - Adding text to your project (horizontal and vertical text).
  
- **Character and Paragraph Panels**  
  - Control text formatting (font, size, kerning, leading, etc.).

## 10. Working with Shapes and Vectors
- **Shape Tool**  
  Create shapes such as rectangles, ellipses, and custom paths.
  
- **Pen Tool for Vectors**  
  Drawing precise vector paths and shapes.

- **Editing Paths**  
  Modifying paths with anchor points and handles.

## 11. Exporting and Saving Files
- **Saving Your Work**  
  - **PSD Format:** Retains all layers and editing information.
  
- **Exporting for Web**  
  - Optimizing images for web use (File > Export > Save for Web).
